Key Points:
The script searches for special files (_setpath_, _setthispath_, and _setfromcsv_b).
If _setfromcsv_b5_ is found, it reads the path from the specified cell in the CSV file (e.g., cell B5).
The search only goes one level deep into each drive.
The pandas library is used to read the CSV file.
This solution works for cross-platform environments (Windows, Linux, macOS), and it dynamically sets paths based on files and CSV input.




Search all available drives (depending on the operating system).
Search for specific filenames (like _setpath_, _setthispath_, and _setfromcsv_b5_) at the first level of directories.
Set the path dynamically based on which file is found.
If _setpath_ is found, set the path to that drive.
If _setthispath_ is found, set the path to the folder where the file is located.
If _setfromcsv_b5_ is found, read the path from the CSV file and use the value from cell B5.
Hereâ€™s a Python script to handle this:



Explanation:
read_path_from_csv():

This function uses pandas to read the CSV file and extract the value from a specified cell (e.g., B5). The cell_reference argument specifies the cell in Excel-style (e.g., B5 means the 5th row, 2nd column).
get_available_drives():

This function determines the available drives depending on the operating system. On Windows, it checks for drive letters (A: to Z:), while on Linux and macOS, it checks typical mount points (e.g., /media, /mnt, /Volumes).
search_for_setpath_file():

This function searches the first level of each drive for specific filenames (_setpath_, _setthispath_, _setfromcsv_b).
set_path_based_on_file():

Based on the found filename, this function sets the path:
_setpath_: Sets the path to the drive root.
_setthispath_: Sets the path to the folder where the file is located.
_setfromcsv_b: Reads the path from the specified cell (e.g., B5) in the CSV file.
choose_path():

This is the main function that iterates through the drives and searches for the filenames. Once found, it dynamically sets the path based on the file's name and content.
